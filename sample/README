This is a very small sample for demonstration of basic ideas of SCMS.
To run the sample launch SCMS in GAE environment, go to /editor (e.g. http://localhost:8080/editor), upload all.zip like an entire site.
After that a default page should be set in /editor/pages ("Pages") to "albums". 
The website is ready to use :-).
